\begin{abstract}
  We define strong order types and $k$-strong order types and use them to
  show that any collinear set of vertices in a plane drawing of a graph
  $G$ is also a free collinear set (Dujmovi\'c and Frati 2016) of $G$.

\section{The Whole Thing}

For two distinct points $p$ and $q$,
$\overline{pq}$ denotes the line segment with endpoints $p$ and
$q$, $\overrightarrow{pq}$ denotes the ray originating at $p$ and
containing $q$, $\overleftarrow{pq}\equiv \overrightarrow{qp}$, 
$p\!\overrightarrow{q} = \overrightarrow{pq}\setminus \overline{pq}$, 
and $\overleftarrow{p}\!q\equiv q\overrightarrow{p}$.

Let $P=p_1,\ldots,p_n$ be a sequence of points in the plane (possibly
with repetitions).  The \emph{full order type} of $P$ is a function
$f_P\colon \{1,\ldots,n\}^3\to \{0,1,\ldots,8\}$ defined as
\[
   f_P(i,j,k) = 
   \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{if $p_i=p_j=p_k$} \\
      1 & \text{if $p_i=p_j\neq p_k$} \\
      2 & \text{if $p_i=p_k\neq p_k$} \\
      3 & \text{if $p_j=p_k\neq p_i$} \\
      4 & \text{if $p_i,p_j,p_k$ distinct and collinear with $p_k\in\overline{p_ip_j}$} \\
      5 & \text{if $p_i,p_j,p_k$ distinct and collinear with $p_k\in p_i\!\overrightarrow{p_j}$} \\
      6 & \text{if $p_i,p_j,p_k$ distinct and collinear with $p_k\in\overleftarrow{p_i}\!p_j$} \\
      7 & \text{if $p_i,p_j,p_k$ are oriented counterclockwise} \\
      8 & \text{if $p_i,p_j,p_k$ are oriented clockwise} \\
   \end{cases}
\]
For a sequence $L=\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n$ of lines, none of which is
vertical, we define the full order type of $f_L$ of $L$ as the full
order type of the point sequence $\phi(\ell_1),\ldots,\phi(\ell_n)$,
we where $\phi$ is the usual point/line duality that takes the line
$\ell=\{(x,y): y=ax+b\}$ onto the point $(a,b)$.

For a point sequence $P=p_1,\ldots,p_n$, we define a nested sequence
of point sequences $\langle P_i:i\in \N\}$ inductively, as follows.
For the base case, $P_1=P$. In the general case, $P_{i}$ is obtained from
$P_{i-1}$ by considering the sequence of at most $\binom{|P_{i-1}|}{2}$
lines $L=\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_{n_i}$ determined by pairs of distinct points
in $P_{i-1}$, ordered in some canonical way.  These lines determine
a set of dual points $\phi(L)=\phi(\ell_1),\ldots,\phi(\ell_{n_i}$,
and $P_{i+1}=P_i\oplus\phi(L)$, where $\oplus$ denotes the concatenation
of two sequences.

Finally, we define the \emph{$k$ full order type}, $f^k(P)$ of the
point set $P$ as $f(P_k)$.  We use the following lemma to establish the
equivalence between collinear sets and free collinear sets.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{main}
   Let $P=p_1,\ldots,p_n$ and $Q=q_1,\ldots,q_n$ be two point
   sequences such that  $f^k(P)=f^{k}(Q)$.  Then, for every point
   $p\in \R^2$ that is not collinear with any two points in $P_k$,
   there exists a $q\in\R^2$ such that $f^{k-1}_{p_1,\ldots,p_n,p} =
   f^{k-1}_{q_1,\ldots,q_n,q}$.
\end{lem}

Before proving \lemref{main}, we first point out that it can not be
strengthened by replacing $f^{k-1}$ with $f^k$. Indeed, the two point
sets in \figref{counterexample} have the same full order type but if
we place a point $p$ in the triangle bounded by the lines in the left
figure, there is no corresponding location to place $q$ in the right 
figure.

\begin{proof}
   Consider the arrangement, $A_P$, of the set, $L_P$, of lines formed
   by pairs of points in $P_{k-1}$. (These are the lines whose dual
   points define $P_k\setminus P_{k-1}$.)  The combinatorial structure
   of $A_P$---in particular, the set of faces in $A_P$---is completely
   determined by the strong order type of $P_k$.

   By assumption, the point $p$ is not contained in any line in
   $L_P$, so $p$ is in the interior of some face, $F_p$, of $A_P$.
   The exact location $p$ in $F_p$ does not matter: For any point
   $p'$, in the interior of $F_p$, $f^{k-1}_{p_1,\ldots,p_n,p} =
   f^{k-1}_{p_1,\ldots,p_n,p'}$.  This last observation is due to the fact
   that the (left-of/right-of) relationship between a (directed) line in
   $L$ and   a point $p'$ is determined by the orientation---clockwise
   or counterclockwise---of $a,b,p'$, where $a$ and $b$ are two points
   in $P_{i-1}$.

   Since the combinatorial structure of $A_P$ is completely determined
   by the strong order type, $f^{k}_P$ of $P_k$, and $f^k_{P}=f^k_Q$, it
   follows that the arrangement $A_Q$ of the set of lines $L_Q$ determined
   by pairs of points in $Q_{k-1}$ is combinatorially equivalent to $A_P$.
   In particular, $A_Q$ contains a face $F_Q$ that is equivalent to $F_P$.
   Taking any point $q$ in the interior of $F_Q$ produces a point that
   satisfies the conditions of the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{free}
   Let $G$ be a planar graph.  Then any collinear set in $G$ is a free
   collinear set in $G$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
   Suppose $G$ has a plane drawing with its vertex coordinates at position
   $P=p_1,\ldots,p_n$ so that vertices $p_1,\ldots,u_r$ appear, in order,
   on the $x$-axis, and $p_{r+1},\ldots,p_n$ are not on the $x$-axis.
   Therefore, $G$ has a collinear set of size $r$.

   For a sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$, we can randomly perturb each
   of $p_{r+1},\ldots,p_n$ by a distance of at most $\epsilon$ and the
   drawing will remain a plane drawing. (The supremeum such value of
   $\epsilon$ is called the \emph{tolerance} of $G$ \cite{X}.)  After this
   perturbation, the only points on the $x$-axis are $p_1,\ldots,p_r$,
   no two points in $P$ have the same $x$-coordinate and no three
   vertices in the drawing are collinear, unless all three vertices are
   in $p_1,\ldots,p_r$.

   To prove the lemma, we must show that, for any $x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_r$
   there exists a plane drawing of $G$ so that $p_i$ is drawn
   at $q_i=(x_i,0)$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$.  We will prove
   something stronger: There exists $q_{r+1},\ldots,q_n$ such that the
   point sequence $q_1,\ldots,q_n$ has the same strong order type as
   $p_1,\ldots,p_n$. 

   We first observe that, for any $k\in\N$,
   $f^{k}_{p_1,\ldots,p_r}=f^{k}_{q_1,\ldots,q_r}$.
   In particular, this is true for $k=n-r+1$.  Now, by the
   random perturbation, $p_{r+1}$ satisfies the conditions
   of \lemref{main}, so we can find a point $q_{r+1}$ so that
   $f^{k-1}_{q_1,\ldots,q_{r+1}}=f^{k-1}_{p_1,\ldots,p_{r+1}}$.  In the
   same way, for each of $i=2,\ldots,n-r$ we can find $q_i$ so that
   $f^{k-i}_{q_1,\ldots,q_{r+i}} = f^{k-i}_{p_1,\ldots,p_{r+i}}$.
   In particular, the end result is the point sequence $q_1,\ldots,q_n$
   such that $f^{1}(q_1,\ldots,q_n)=f^{1}(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$, i.e.,
   $q_1,\ldots,q_n$ has the same strong order type as $p_1,\ldots,p_n$.
\end{proof}
