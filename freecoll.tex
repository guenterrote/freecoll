\begin{abstract}
  We show that if a planar graph $G$ has a planar straight-line drawing
  in which a subset $S$ of its vertices are collinear, then there is a
  planar straight-line drawing of $G$ in which all vertices in $S$ are
  on the $y$-axis and in which they have prescribed $y$-coordinates.
  This solves an open problem posed by Ravsky and Verbitsky in 2008.
  In their terminology, we show that every collinear set is free.
  This result has applications in graph drawing, untangling, universal
  point subsets, and related areas.

\section{Introduction}

In a planar graph, $G=(V,E)$, a \emph{collinear set} is a set of vertices
$S\subset V$ such that $G$ has a planar straight-line drawing in which
all vertices in $S$ are drawn on a single line.  A collinear set $S$
is a \emph{free collinear set} if, for any collinear set of points
$X\subset\R^2$, $|X|=|S|$, $G$ has a planar straight-line drawing in
which the vertices of $S$ are drawn on the points in $X$.  Ravsky and
Verbitsky \cite{ravsky.verbitsky:on} ask the following question:

\begin{quote}
   How far or close are parameters $\tilde{v}(G)$ and $\bar{v}(G)$? It
   seems that \emph{a priori} we even cannot exclude equality. To clarify
   this question, it would be helpful to (dis)prove that every collinear
   set in any straight line drawing is free.
\end{quote}

In the context of this quote, $\tilde{v}(G)$ and $\bar{v}(G)$ are the
respective sizes of the largest collinear set and largest free collinear
set in $G$.  In this note, we prove that $\tilde{v}(G)=\bar{v}(G)$ by
showing that every collinear set is a free collinear set.  

Dujmovi\'c and Frati gave the following characterization of collinear sets:
\begin{thm}
   A set $S$ of the vertices of a graph $G$ is a collinear set if
   and only if there exists a (topological) drawing of $G$ and a simple
   curve $C$ both endpoints in a common face of $G$ and such that each
   vertex of $S$ is drawn on $C$ and the intersection of each edge with
   $C$ has at most one connected component.
\end{thm}
The surprising aspect of this characterization is that one can
simultaneously straighten the drawing of the graph so that it becomes a
straight line drawing and straighten the Jordan curve so that it becomes
(say) the y-axis while preserving the combinatorial relationship between
$C$ and $G$.

\subsection{Proof Sketch}


Without loss of generality, we may assume that the the graph we are
interested in is a (topological) triangulation $T$ and the line we are
interested in is the y-axis.

%Our proof has three steps:
%\begin{enumerate}
%   \item Using combinatorial operations---edge subdivision, edge
%   contraction, and the removal of separating triangles---and induction
%   on the number of vertices, we reduce to a problem in which $T$
%   has no separating triangles and every edge of $T$ is incident to a
%   triangle that has two edges intersecting the y-axis and $S$ is an
%   independent set that is on the y-axis.
%
%   \item Using local operations---removing edges and vertices and
%   introducting edges---on $T$ we obtain a (topological) quadrangulation
%   $Q$ for which every edge intersects the y-axis and $S$ is on the
%   y-axis.  Furthermore, $Q$ is structured so that, if we take any
%   non-crossing straigh-line drawing of $Q$ we can rei
%
%   \item Thus we have a quadrangulation $Q$ whose edges intersect
%   the y-axis in the order $e_1,\ldots,e_m$ and the vertex set of $Q$
%   contains $S$, still on the y-axis.
%
%   Let $y_1\le\cdots\le y_m$ be any sequence of numbers such that
%   $y_i=y_{i+1}$ if and only if $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$ have a common endpoint
%   in $S$.  We show that, for any $\epsilon >0$, $Q$ has a planar
%   straight-line drawing such that the intersection of $e_i$ with the
%   y-axis is at $y_i\pm\epsilon$.  Furthermore, if $y_i=y_{i+1}$, then
%   the intersection of $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$ with the y-axis is exactly
%   at $y_i$. In this way every vertex of $S$ is drawn on the y-axis
%   at precisely the desired location.
%\end{enumerate}


works in three basic steps: 


\section{Definitions}

Jordan curve

Embedded planar graph = each vertex is a distinct point and each edge is a closed curve whose endpoints are its two vertices.  No two edges intersect except possibly at their common endpoint.

Triangulation = $n$-vertex embedded graph in which each face is bounded by a 3-cycle.

separating triangle

edge contraction

we use the convention of listing the vertices of a face in counterclockwise order.

Quadrangulation = $n$-vertex embedded graph in which each face is bounded by a 4-cycle. Has $2n-4$ edges.

Drawing = Embedding of a graph with no crossings

Straight-line drawing = drawing (implies non-crossing) in which edges are represented by line segments 


\section{The Proof}

\subsection{Drawing Quadrangulations}
\seclabel{quad}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{quad}
    TODO: Add something about prescribed location of three outer face vertices.
    Let $Q$ be a quadrangulation, let $C:[0,1]\to\R^2$ be a simple curve
   both of whose endpoints are both contained in the interior of some
   face $f$ of $Q$ and whose intersection with each edge of $Q$ consists
   of at most one point and that does not contain
    any vertex of $Q$, let $e_1,\ldots,e_m$ the edges of $Q$ in the
    (cyclic) order they are intersected by $C$, and let $y_1<\cdots<y_m$
    be any increasing sequence of numbers.  Then $Q$ has a straight-line
    drawing in which, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, the intersection
    of $e_i$ with the y-axis is a single point $(0,y_i)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
   G\"unter's proof showing that the resulting system of equations has a unique solution.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
   Let $Q$ be a straight-line drawing of a quadrangulation drawn so
   that each of its (closed) edges intersects the y-axis in exactly one
   point. Let $v$ be a vertex of $Q$ that is not on the y-axis, whose
   incident edges cross the y-axis at $y_1'<\cdots<y_d'$ and suppose that
   no other edges of $Q$ cross the y-axis in the interval $[y_1',y_d']$.
   Then, for any $y'\in[y_1',y_d']$, moving $v$ to $(0,y')$ yields a
   straight-line drawing of $Q$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Easy geometric argument.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Drawing Collinear Sets}


We will sometimes make use of this simple fact:
\begin{obs}\obslabel{quad}
  If $q=abcd$ is a simple quadrilateral, then neither of the segments $ac$
  or $bd$ cross any of the edges of $q$
\end{obs}

\begin{thm}
   Let $T$ be a triangulation and let $C:[0,1]\to\R^2$ be a simple curve
   both of whose endpoints are both contained in the interior of some
   face $f$ of $T$ and whose intersection with each edge of $Q$ consists
   of at most one point. Let $r_1,\ldots,r_k$ be the sequence of
   vertices and edges of $Q$ that are intersected by $C$, and ordered in
   the order that they are intersected by $C$, and let $y_1<\cdots<y_k$
   be any sequence of numbers.  Then, for any $\epsilon>0$, $T$ has a
   straight-line drawing in which,
   for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, 
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item $r_i$ is drawn on the y-axis, with y-coordinate $y_i$,
         if $r_i$ is a vertex; or
       \item (if $r_i$ is an edge) the intersection of $r_i$ with the
         y-axis has a y-coordinate in the interval
         $[y_i-\epsilon,y_i+\epsilon]$.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
   Make a Jordan curve $J$ by joining the endpoints of $C$ with a path
   contained in the interior of $f$.  Let $L$ and $R$ be the bounded
   and unbounded components, respectively, of $\R^2\setminus J$. Let
   $\bar{L}=J\cup L$ and $\bar{R}^+=J\cup R$ denote the closures of $L$
   and $R$.  We say that an edge of $T$ is a \emph{crossing edge} if
   it intersects $R$ but is not contained in $R$.  (Note the asymmetry
   of this definition with respect to $L$ and $R$.)  A crossing edge
   is a \emph{proper crossing edge} if it intersects both $R$ and $L$.
   We say that points in $L$ are \emph{to the left of $C$} and points
   in $R$ are \emph{to the right of $C$}.

   We will prove a slightly stronger extension of the theorem: 
   Let $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$
   denote the three vertices of $f$, in counterclockwise order.
   If $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in \bar{J}^+$ or $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in \bar{J}^+$,
   then the theorem is trivial.  Therefore,  
   assume without loss of generality that $\alpha,\beta\in L$
   and $\gamma\in R$.  Let $\Delta$ be any triangle with two
   vertices $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$ to the left of the y-axis and one
   vertex $\gamma'$ to the right of the y-axis and such that the boundary
   of $\Delta$ intersects the y-axis at contains $(0,y_1)$ and $(0,y_k)$.
   We will show that $T$ has a straight-line drawing that satisfies the
   conditions of the theorem and in which $\alpha$ is drawn at $\alpha'$,
   $\beta$ is drawn at $\beta'$ and $\gamma$ is drawn at $\gamma'$.
   We will prove this by induction on the number of vertices of $T$.

   \paragraph{Separating Triangles:}
   If $T$ contains a separating triangle $xyz$ then we remove the
   component of $T-\{x,y,z\}$ that does not contain any vertex of $f$ to
   obtain a triangulation $T'$ in which $xyz$ is a face.  Observe that,
   since the intersection of $C$ with each of $xy$, $yz$ and $zx$
   consists of at most a single point, the vertices and edges of $T$
   intersected by $C$ that are not in $T'$ appear as a contiguous
   subsequence $r_i,\ldots,r_j$.

   Observe that each of $r_{i-1}$ and $r_{j+1}$ is either an edge
   or vertex of the triangle $xyz$.  Set $\epsilon'$ to be any
   value less than $\min\{\epsilon,y_{i}-y_{i-1}, y_{j+1}-y_j\}$.
   and apply induction on $T'$ using the value $\epsilon'$
   and the sequences $r_1,\ldots,r_{i-1},r_{j+1},\ldots,r_k$ and
   $y_1,\ldots,y_{i-1},y_{j+1},\ldots,y_k$ to obtain a drawing of $T'$.
   In the resulting drawing $xyz$ becomes a triangular face $\Delta'$.

   In the resulting drawing, Let $y_{i-1}'$ and $y_{j+1}'$ be
   the respective y-coordinates of the intersections of $r_{i-1}$
   and $r_{j+1}$ with the y-axis.  By our choice of $\epsilon'$,
   $y_{i-1}'<y_i<\cdots<y_j<y_{j+1}'$.

   Let $T''$ be the triangulation obtained by removing, from $T$, the
   component of $T-\{x,y,z\}$ that contains some vertex of $f$.  Now we
   apply induction on $T''$ using the triangle $\Delta'$ and the sequences
   $r_{i-1},\ldots,r_{j+1}$ and $y_{i-1}',y_i,\ldots,y_{j},y_{j+1}'$.
   Combining the drawings of $T'$ and $T''$ yields a drawing of $T$
   that satisfies the requirements of the theorem.  Thus, we may assume
   that $T$ has no separating triangles.

   \paragraph{Contractible Edges:}
   We say that a triangular face of $T$ is a \emph{proper crossing face}
   if it is incident to two proper crossing edges.  We say that an edge
   of $T$ is \emph{contractible} if it is not on the boundary of any
   proper crossing face and at least one of its endpoints is not on $C$.

   If $T$ contains a contractible edge $xy$ with $y\not\in C$,
   then we contract $xy$ to obtain a new vertex $u$ in a smaller
   triangulation $T'$.   We can then apply induction on $T'$ with
   the value $\epsilon'=\epsilon/2$ to obtain a drawing of $T'$ that
   satisfies all the conditions of the theorem except that now each proper
   crossing edge $e_i$ intersects the y-axis with distance $\epsilon/2$ of
   $(0,y_i)$.  Let $d$ be any number less than the minimum of $\epsilon/2$
   and the distance between the $v$ and the y-axis.  To obtain a drawing
   of $T$ we uncontract $v$ by placing $x$ at the location of $v$ and
   $y$ within distance $d$ of $x$ and in a direction determined by the
   directions of the edges in $T'$ incident to $v$.  The choice of $d$
   the use of the value $\epsilon'=\epsilon/2$ in the induction on $T'$
   ensures that the resulting straight-line drawing of $T$ satisfies
   the requirements of the theorem.

   \paragraph{The Base Case:}
   The base case in our inductive proof occurs when $T$ has no separating
   triangles and no contractible edges.  Note that this implies that
   every vertex $v$ of $T$ is incident to at least one crossing edge
   since, otherwise every edge incident to $v$ is contractible.
  
   Next,  note that if the number, $n$, of vertices of $T$ is 3 then
   the theorem is trivial, so we assume from this point on that $T$
   has at least 4 vertices.

   We will now show how to remove edges and vertices from $T$ in such a
   way that we are left with a quadrangulation $Q$ that only crossing
   edges.  We can then use the results from \secref{quad}
   to draw $Q$ so that it satisifies the conditions of the theorem.
   While removing edges and vertices of $T$ we will show how these edges
   and vertices can be added back to the drawing of $Q$ to obtain a
   drawing of $T$.  All of this will be done with any $\epsilon$s. The
   intersection of each $r_i$ with with the y-axis will be exactly
   at $(0,y_i)$.

   Consider the graph $H$ consisting of only the non-crossing edges of
   $T$ and their endpoints.  Some face $g$ of $H$ contains the jordan
   curve $J$.  We claim that $H$ is outerplanar because every vertex of
   $H$ is incident to at least one crossing edge and is therefore on the
   boundary of $g$.  Furthermore, every edge $e$ of $H$ is on the boundary
   of $g$ since, otherwise, neither of the two triangles incident on $e$
   would be proper crossing triangles and $e$ would be contractible.
   This means that $H$ is a \emph{cactus graph}---a graph in which each
   edge is incident to at most one cycle.  Furthermore, each cycle of $H$
   is a 3-cycle.  To see why, observe that, since $T$ is a triangulation,
   if $H$ contained a $k$-cycle for $k\ge 4$, this cycle would have a chord.

   Consider each 2-connected component of $H$ (which is either a 3-cycle
   or a single edge) and assume, without loss of generality that the
   component is contained in $\bar L$.  There are several cases to
   consider:
   \begin{enumerate}
	\item The component is a single edge $xy$.  Let $xya$ and $yxb$
	be the two faces of $T$ incident to $xy$.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item if either $a$ or $b$ is in $\bar L$ the one of $xya$
            or $yxb$ is a cycle in $H$, so $xy$ is not a 2-connected
            component of $H$.  \item both $a$ and $b$ are in $R$.  In this
            case, removing the edge $xy$ from $T$ creates a quadrangular
            face $xbya$ consisting of only crossing edges. \obsref{quad}
            ensures that, after drawing this smaller graph, the edge $xy$
            can be added without introducing crossings.  (It is worth
            noting that the analysis of this case remains true even if
            $xy$ is an edge of the outer face.)
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The component is a face $xyz$ of $T$.  Since none of $xy$,
        $yz$, or $zx$ was contracted, there exists vertices $a,b,c\in R$
        (possibly not distinct) such that $xya$, $yzb$ and $zxc$ are
        triangular faces of $T$.\footnote{Note that this is even true if
        $xy$ was not contracted because $x,y\in C$. In that case there
        is still an $a\in R$.}  There are three cases to consider:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $a=b=c$.  In this case (after appropriate relabelling),
            the cycle $xya$ contains $z$ in its interior.  Since $T$
            contains no separating triangles, this means that $xya$
            is the outer face of $T$. In this case, we can apply
            the theorem inductively on two in dependent subproblems
            contained in the interior of $xza$ and $azy$, respectively.
          \item $a=b\neq c$. In this case we remove the vertex $y$
            and the edge $xz$.  This create a quadrangular face $zcxa$
            consisting of only crossing edges.  Given a drawing of
            this smaller graph that satisifies the requirements of the
            theorem, \obsref{quad} ensures that we can add the edge $xz$
            without introducing crossings.  Note that $y$ is incident
            on the crossing edge $ya$, which has a prescribed point $p$
            at which it should intersect the y-axis.  Therefore we place
            $y$ at the intersection of the vertical line through $z$
            and the line containing $p$ and $a$.
          \item $a$, $b$, and $c$ are three distinct vertices of $T$.
            In this case we remove the edges $xy$, $yz$ and $zx$ and add
            the edge $yc$.  This creates two quadrangular faces $ycxa$
            and $ybzc$.  In the drawing of this smaller graph, the
            vertices $x$ and $z$ are reflex vertices of these two faces.
            Thus we can remove the edge $yc$ and add the edges $xy$,
            $yz$ adn $zx$ without introducing crossings.
      \end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}
   After applying the preceding reduction to each 2-connected component
   of $H$ we are left with a graph $Q$ that contains only crossing
   edges.  The graph $Q$ is therefore bipartite and therefore contains
   no triangles.  Furthermore, no reduction creates any face with more
   than 4 vertices. Therefore $Q$ is a quadrangulation consisting only
   of crossing edges.  

   This is still insufficient to apply \lemref{quad}, since \lemref{quad}
   requires that the curve $C$ does not contain any vertices of $Q$.
   To fix this, first note that any vertex $r_i$ on $C$ is only incident
   only to crossing edges and therefore the neighbours of $r_i$ are all
   contained in $R$. Thus, we can deform $C$ in the neighbourhood of $r_i$
   so that $r_i$ moves into the interior of $L$ and $C$ intersects each
   of $r_i$'s incident edges $e_1,\ldots,e_d$ in exactly one point.  Now,
   to apply \lemref{quad} we must specify numbers $y_1',\ldots,y_d'$ where
   $(0,y_i')$ is the intersection point between $e_j$ and the y-axis.
   To do this we choose any $y_1'<\cdots<y_d'$ satisfying
   \[
       y_{i-1} < y_1' < y_i < y_d' < y_{i+1} \enspace .
   \]
   By doing this for each vertex $r_i$ in $C$ we obtain a curve $C'$ and
   a sequence $y_1''<\cdots<y_m''$ on which we can apply \lemref{quad} to
   find a drawing of $Q$.  Now this drawing of $Q$ does not yet satisfy
   the requirements of the theorem because there are vertices $r_i\in
   C$ that are not in $C'$. However, the choice of $y_1'<\cdots<y_d'$
   described above ensures that moving the vertex $r_i$ to $(0,y_i)$
   does not introduce any crossings and gives a drawing of $Q$ that
   satisfies all the relevant requirements of the theorem.  Finally,
   in the process of building $Q$ described above, we showed how the
   drawing of $Q$ can be extended to a drawing of $T$ that satisifies
   all the requirements of the theorem.
\end{proof}



\section{Discussion}

Discuss all the consequences of \lemref{free} here\ldots
Basically, any graph class that has a collinear set of size $f(n)$ can 
be untangled while keeping $f(n)$ vertices fixed.  For such graph classes,
every point set of size $f(n)$ is a universal subset for $n$-vertex graphs
in the class.
