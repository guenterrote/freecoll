embedding -> drawing (It is the simpler word, and embedding has the
connotation of being injective.)

admissible -> proper good. (in accordance with the original definition).

Definition moved together with Thm.2. (first appearance of this
concept).

Thm 5 (restatement of Thm.2) moved to a separate subsection.
PROPOSAL: Move it to Thm.2, or move it closer to the place where it is used?
(Apparently it is used 2x).
CHANGES, up to version Fri, Sep 21.


Reformulation of Theorem 6.
The outer face is an afterthought.

Removed the fully specified ordering around a vertex (previous Fig.3).
Moved the figure backward, now Fig.6
(that e1 and e_m are boundary edges is part of the theorem statement.)

The boundary equations are shown in (7), so that we can refer to them.

Changed >epsilon into >=epsilon in the eps-strong constraints.

Lemma 2. Proof rewritten.

Section 3.5 "A Parametric Family of Linear Systems"
Rewritten, including proof of Lemma 5. It is now shorter.
I hope I did not delete anything essential.
