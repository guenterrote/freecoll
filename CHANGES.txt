MAJOR CHANGES introduced in the version by GÃ¼nter, 21 Sep 2019
==============================================================

embedding -> drawing (It is the simpler word, and embedding has the
connotation of being injective.)

I have reformulated the definition of drawing (previously
embedding) in Sec.2. Gamma has been used only in a few places and it was easy
to eliminate those.
Please tell me if you see some problems where this might cause some
confusion in some places.
In particular, I have changed the frightening sentence 
"For a given F\'ary embedding $G$, we often address the problem of
..." to something simpler.

admissible -> proper good. (in accordance with the original definition).

Definition moved together with Thm.2. (first appearance of this
concept).

Thm 5 (restatement of Thm.2) moved to a separate subsection.
PROPOSAL: Move it to Thm.2, or move it closer to the place where it is used?
(Apparently it is used 2x).


Reformulation of Theorem 6.
The outer face is now an afterthought.

Removed the fully specified ordering around a vertex (previous Fig.3).
Moved the figure backward, now Fig.6
(that e1 and e_m are boundary edges is part of the theorem statement.)

The boundary equations are shown in (7), so that we can refer to them.

Changed >epsilon into >=epsilon in the eps-strong constraints.

Lemma 2. Proof rewritten.

Section 3.5 "A Parametric Family of Linear Systems"
Rewritten, including proof of Lemma 5. It is now shorter.
I hope I did not delete anything essential.

changed notation from A_t to A^t, y^t b^t etc. but kept
s(t) to emphasize the functional dependency.

I added a picture for Claim 1 in the "Base Case". p.25.
